#                  Pick Good Trading Pairs Settings
# -----------------------------------------------------------------

# We have changed the way we pick pairs as of v1.0.6 we let the bot do the work for us.
#
# We now manage by exception and black list the pairs we dont want to trade
# and only take the top volume pairs. We let the bot take its time to pick good pairs
# while our pairs log clears or we DCA until we clear the pairs.
# ProfitTrailer now uses Bolinger Bands strategies to buy low and sell high.
#
# Our goal is to be in and out of a trade quickly. We therefore want pairs that will clear quickly
# This method hinges on picking good pairs you think are going to be volatile.
#
# When picking pairs manually You want to look for a good argument
# happening on the coin i.e. lots of ups and downs with a pattern like a saw blade.
# The longer that sawblade pattern (oscilation) goes sideways or upwards the better.
#
# If market goes bad try the following two strategies:
#
# a. Shotgun pairs - target any pair that has had a rise in the last 3 days
# b. Sniper pairs - sniper pairs use 3 passes:
#     1. First pass is to look for sawtooth pattern in normal manner by eyeballing the charts, this gets you a baseline set of pairs to work with;
#     2. Second pass is to examine baseline pairs and use the charts to target any pair that has had a rise in the last 3 days and has high volume only; and
#     3. Third pass is to use your exchange and target pairs with > 600 in volume only.
#
# Here is what the passes look like, note each pass has less and less pairs:
# 1st pass using charts and sawtooth pattern - DEFAULT_enabled_pairs = ADT,ARK,BAY,BCC,BLK,CFI,CVC,DASH,DCR,DCT,DGB,DNT,EBST,EDG,ENG,ENRG,ETC,ETH,EXP,FCT,FUN,GNT,HMQ,IOP,KMD,LBC,LMC,LSK,MAID,NAV,NEO,NLG,NXT,OK,OMG,QTUM,RCN,SALT,SNT,STEEM,STORJ,SYS,UBQ,VIA,VRM,WAVES,XEM,XLM,XMR,XRP,XVG,XZC,ZEC,ZEN
# 2nd pass using charts and looking for rise in last 3 days volume - DEFAULT_enabled_pairs = ADT,BCC,DGB,DNT,EDG,ETC,ETH,IOP,KMD,LSK,MAID,NEO,RCN,SALT,SYS,UBQ,XEM,XLM,XRP,XVG
# 3rd pass using exchange volumes > 600 - DEFAULT_enabled_pairs = ADA,DGB,IOP,LSK,SALT,XEM,XLM,XRP,XVG

#             EL TORO - BUY STRATEGY - ProfitTrailer 2.0.6 to 2.0.9
#
# El Toro is an agressive scalping strategy that works in all market conditions.
# The Buy strategy makes use of the DEFAULT_buy_min_change_percentage to
# look for pairs that have lost 5% in the last 24 hours. It then looks for a
# buy signal within the last hour using an EMACROSS of 8/13. It then looks
# for an opportunity to buy a small dip in the price using a negative EMAGAIN
# pick pairs at the bottom of their trade cycle. It uses RSI to confirm we
# are at the bottom of the trade cycle to ensure we buy the dip. Finally it
# trails the price to ensure we get the best buy.
# It also employs the take profit
# DEFAULT_take_profit_percentage settings to sell if we are at 2% profit
# or better but havent sold in over 10 minutes (2 candles) allowing for a half
# a percent threshold. If we exceed that threshold the 10 minute countdown resets.
#
# This strategy works best in a Bull market, but will work in a bear or sideways
# market just much slower as volatility will be low in those markets.

# we are at the bottom of the trade cycle to ensure we buy the dip. Finally
# it trails the price to ensure we get the best buy. It may not buy during

# This strategy works in either a Bear or Bull market. It is good to

#
# El Toro is an agressive scalping strategy that works in all market conditions.
# The sell strategy employs the take profit DEFAULT_take_profit_percentage
# settings to sell if we are at 1% profit or better but havent sold in over
# 10 minutes (2 candles) allowing for a half a percent threshold. If we exceed
# that threshold the 10 minute countdown resets. It uses both the GAIN and

# you set. It uses RSI to confirm we are at the top of the trade cycle to ensure we
# sell at the peak. It uses a low GAIN and DEFAULT_trailing_profit percentage
# to scalp profits as quickly as possible.
#
# This strategy works best in a Bull market, will work in a bear or sideways
# market just much slower as volatility will be low in those markets.
